IronMap

====


When hiring people, evaluating their technical skills is a big challenge. Ideally you would like to have absolute information about a person's skillset while hiring them.

IronMap has a simple proposal. Give everyone a test where each question needs a specific skill to be solved. This is nothing new as hackerearth, hackerrank, codechef all do the same things. Where IronMap differs is that it is a descriptive tool. Here the task is not to solve the question, rather to solve it well.

After your candidate set has taken the tests, unsupervised clustering is performed to group the people into clusters based on their skillset. The typical algorithms used for this are PCA/ t-sne.
